  How to configure PageJinn
---


In addition to the actual software, a configuration file *config.json* is written to the PageJinn home directory (by default, the user's Documents folder) during installation:

`/Users/[username]/Documents/PageJinn/PAG/config.json `


The configuration file contains default settings that affect the behavior of PageJinn.
You will probably need to change some of the settings, such as the path to your K4 system and user and password, before PageJinn is ready for use.

You can change the configuration file by hand. However, all important and necessary settings for operation can also be made within PageJinn.
