 ## Moving pages

You can move pages and page ranges by Drag&Drop to a different position in the issue.

Select the first page by holding down the **** key (Option) and drag it. The page gets a *yellow* frame while dragging. Any page that is dragged over will have a pink frame. When you release the mouse, the page is inserted *behind* this pink reference page.

{{< alert title="Note" >}}Moving pages *within a range of pages* is not currently supported.{{< /alert >}}

 ### Moving Page ranges

You can also move page ranges. 

Hold down the **Option-keyste** and the **Shift-key**  while dragging the *first* page of a page range. 

{{< alert title="Note" >}}Only when you release the mouse all pages belonging to the range are actually moved to the new position.{{< /alert >}}


As with all *actions*, moving does not make changes to the document until you click **Execute**.
